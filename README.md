#### User Research

Our top 5 user research insights were:
1. Non-linguistic communication is very important, since many users will have a low level of English, and others a low level of literacy.  Accessibility is also particularly relevant as many users may be older and are more likely to have health problems.

 - *We have designed our app with a lot of icons and very simple language support (e.g. one word) to make communication as clear as possible.  We have tried to minimise longer supporting text, e.g. making info about the app an optional step that the user can ignore.  We have added next buttons instead of automatic transitions to give slower readers the chance to read bridging screens (e.g. after submitting an edit).*

2. Mental health issues are very prominent in the community, influencing the profile of average users.

 - *We have designed the user journey to be as simple as possible, with a minimal number of steps, to lower barriers as much as possible.  See also pt 3.*

3. Building trust and reassurance are very popular, since this community is vulnerable and may have had bad experiences from people and services offering 'help' in the past.  Their outlook may also be made worse by mental health problems.  Collection of data is a particularly sensitive issue.

 - *We've designed our prototype with minimal use of personal data (just location, if consented to), no log in to avoid saving personal information, reassuring design and privacy statement available*

4. The target community is very diverse with different levels of need. Some people will definitely not be able to help themselves much with an app.
 - *We recognised that our target user is unlikely to be an 'entrenched rough sleeper' or someone with severe mental health issues.  These people clearly need intensive expert support, which an app can't provide.  While we want to make our app as inclusive as possible for people in difficulty, we see our target user more as a 'fallen on hard times' type who has some capacity to recognise and seek help for their problems, and will respond more easily to given support.*

5. Data is not available in one easy-to-use package (e.g. a well-maintained API), so we will need to manually collect and enter data points.
 - *In light of this, it would make sense to focus on one particular area of services or geography.  We have chosen to focus on Islington.*

#### Prototyping
#### User Testing
We wrote our user testing script and questions, and tracked responses in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lQWcgmyjNmRlyZqQc-Wxc6-UaOgbgnxEwWQv-LosjRs/edit)
